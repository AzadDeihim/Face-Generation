Used generative adversarial networks to generate realistic images of human faces.  Implemented metrics to quantitatively evaluate the quality of generated images including generative adversarial metric, and Fr√©chet Inception distance.  

There are 5 different GANs, each following the naming scheme 'GAN name'_net.py, and their respective train scripts named 'GAN name'_train_script.py

Compatible with CelebA dataset
